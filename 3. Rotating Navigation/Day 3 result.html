            <h1>Lazy Sloth</h1>
            <small>Wiki</small>
            <p>Sloths are a group of arboreal Neotropical xenathran mammals, constituting the suborder Folivora. Noted for their slowness of movement, they spend most of their lives hanging upside down in the trees of the tropical rainforests of South America and Central America. </p>

            <h3>Adorable Sloth</h3>
            <img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/134262/original/image-20160816-12998-tf916v.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1200&h=900.0&fit=crop" alt="sloth">
            <p>Sloths can be 60 to 80 cm (24 to 31 in) long and, depending on the species, weigh from 3.6 to 7.7 kg (7.9 to 17.0 lb). Two-toed sloths are slightly larger. Sloths have long limbs and rounded heads with tiny ears. Three-toed sloths also have stubby tails about 5 to 6 cm (2.0 to 2.4 in) long.
            Sloths are so named because of their very low metabolism and deliberate movements, sloth being related to the word slow. This supports their low-energy diet of leaves and avoids detection by predatory hawks and cats that hunt by sight. Sloths are almost helpless on the ground, but are able to swim. The shaggy coat has grooved hair that is host to symbiotic green algae which camouflages the animal in the trees and provides it nutrients. The algae also nourishes sloth moths, some species of which exist solely on sloths.
